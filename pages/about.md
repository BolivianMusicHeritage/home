## About the Bolivian Music Heritage Initiative

Bolivia, a South American country within the Andes, holds some of Latin America's most important music legacies, including UNESCO’s Carnaval de Oruro or Latin America’s most extensive collection of music scores of the colonial era. Despite Bolivia’s many contributions, this country's musical traditions and culture have been vastly understudied. The Bolivian Music Heritage Initiative aims to expand the visibility, accessibility, and research on Bolivian heritage classical music. This digital collection highlights the talent and contributions of Bolivian composers and performers.

The information showcased in this digital collection was collected by the Bolivian Music Heritage Initiative team, either from the composer or performer a part of this collection or through research. 

The Bolivian Music Heritage Initiative team would like to thank all the composers and performers who made this project possible. Thank you. Without you, this project would not have existed.

The creation of this digital collection is supported and funded by the CSUF Digital Ethnic Futures Consortium 2024 Fellowship.
